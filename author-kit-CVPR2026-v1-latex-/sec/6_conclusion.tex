\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, for the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, we have theoretically proven the existence of a phenomenon that we label as domain feature collapse. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrated its existence through experimental simulation across a wide variety of single domain datasets. Notably, we introduced a new benchmark for evaluating  OOD detectors in the under-explored single domain setting, including diverse data such as medical imaging, agriculture, and satellite imagery. We proposed domain filtering, a simple, easily-integrable, two-stage OOD detection process, as a potential counter-measure to domain feature collapse. We hope that this effort encourages further study into single domain out-of-distribution detection and improvements in AI safety.
